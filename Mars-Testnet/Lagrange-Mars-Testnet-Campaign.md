⏰ Event Duration: 14th August, 00:00 (EST) - 10th September, 23:59 (EST)

## Mission 

Lagrange's Mars Testnet is the first attempt to utilize enormous computing and storage resources of Filecoin, Chainlink, BNB Chain, and other blockchains for Web3 developers.

Over the course of four weeks, we will utilize decentralized computing power from different blockchains to create a captivating scene on Planet Mars, including:
- Landscape
- Creatures
- Vehicles, Spaceship
- Buildings and live scene
- CG/Short film

Partners from the realms of AI, gaming, and the metaverse are welcome to join us in this ambitious endeavor by contacting us at tema@filswan.com.


## Goals

- 100 GPUs, 1Million Images
- Validate the large-scale GPU computing on Lagrange Network
- Adaption of models on image generation, e.g. Stable diffusion, Lora, Dall-E
- Developer experience and feedback on space building and datasets
- Multichain Payment and debug on the payment channel
- Validate Lagrange Network’s new GPU marketplace
- Co-working with partners in AI, Gaming, and other metaverse projects
- Community participation in AIGC includes images and scene
- Attract AI and ML enthusiasts/ experts to the Lagrange Network community.
